Grande commented on the album saying: "They can expect a lot of honesty. It's like a direct... you know, it's like it used to be pages lifted from my diary, instead of keeping diary, I would write songs about what was happening in my life. So it's really personal. It's a Motown throwback and pop at the same time, so it's '50s and '60s inspiration mixed with today." The album was inspired by artists like Amy Winehouse, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Madonna, and other like these. Grande worked with artists like Sky Blue from LMFAO, 3OH!3, Kool Kojak, Babyface and Pebe Sebert on the album.</p> <p>She was also working in the studio with Jonas Brothers singer Nick Jonas.

           <img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/97be8949b460ae587c81328238305daf/tumblr_nlehv7tCIo1slzelwo1_500.png" alt="" height="220"> 
          <p>In early 2015, Grande embarked on The Honeymoon Tour of North America and Europe, with several later stops in Asia and South America.The tour earned $14 million in its first 25 performances, selling 290,699 tickets. Following the tour's early success, more dates were added, and the tour concluded in October 2015 after a total of nearly 90 dates.Reviews of the tour performances generally praised Grande's vocals and ability to convey emotion in the songs but found the concerts to be over-produced: "Some judicious editing would've elevated the evening from surprising to satisfying and possibly even shockingly good. As it is, Grande is so busy piling on the spectacle she neglects to highlight the one thing – those deceptively powerful pipes – setting her apart from her contemporaries. "Grande was featured on Cashmere Cat's song "Adore", which was released in March during her Honeymoon Tour; a review in USA Today said: "Grande's towering vocals have never sounded better than on this offbeat R&B track."</p>
          <p>In May / June 2015, Grande released her debut remix album, The Remix featuring remixes of her singles of her debut album Yours Truly and her sophomore album My Everything. The remix album was only released in Japan.</p>
